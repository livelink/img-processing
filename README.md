This project is to show how are working some AI APIs in order to help users to improve or add creatives photos before print. 

Basically we call deepai.org API, remove.gb API (using RestClient), and RMagick to apply the following effects:

- colorizer (deepai.org)
- 'torch-srgan' (deepai.org)
- toonify (deepai.org)
- deepdream (deepai.org)
- waifu2x (deepai.org)
- remove_bg (remove.bg)
- blur (RMagick)
- blur_bg (RMagick + remove.bg)
